# Notebooks

The notebooks in this folder are mainly used to test some of the utility functions of this project.

In order to run these notebooks:
1. you are supposed to have organized the MBS-PBS 10% dataset in the folder `../../data`;
2. you should run `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` on your `<ROOT>` folder
